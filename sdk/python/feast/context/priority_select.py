"""Choosing what survives when a prompt does not fit its budget.

Prompt assembly is a packing problem: a user profile, a watch history and a
catalogue of candidates rarely fit together in a context window, and something
has to give. :func:`priority_select` decides what, keeping sections from the
most important down until the budget is spent::

    selection = priority_select(
        [
            ("critical", system_instructions),
            ("high", f"User profile: {profile}"),
            ("medium", f"Recent history: {history}"),
            ("low", f"Device: {device}"),
        ],
        TokenBudget.of(4096),
    )
    prompt = selection.render()

The decision is deterministic in the sections and the budget alone, so an
OnDemandFeatureView that calls it drops the same sections during training as it
does at serving time.

    Sections are considered from the highest priority down, ties in declaration
    order, and each is kept if what remains of the budget covers it. A section
    too large to fit is dropped and the scan continues, so a small low-priority
    section can still be kept after a large high-priority one was refused.

    Sections whose content is blank are ignored: they would only double a
    separator. ``critical`` sections are never dropped.

    The budget is charged for ``separator`` between each pair of kept sections,

    text across a section boundary, which makes the charge an upper bound on
    what the joined string really costs.
